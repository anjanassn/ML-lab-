## ▶️ How to Run

### ✅ Requirements
Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## 📥 Dataset Setup

1. Download `loan_train.csv` from [Kaggle Loan Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/itsmesunil/bank-loan-modelling).
2. Place the file in the same directory as the notebook (`ML2.ipynb`).
3. Ensure the file name is exactly `loan_train.csv`.
